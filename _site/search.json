Transforming your code and thoughts into a stunning report in one click always blows my mind.\nWhile the default Quarto appearance looks great, there are a few tweaks I always apply to elevate the report even further. Rather than manually adding them each time, I bundled everything into a custom format called lumo.\n\n\nBtw, you can learn how to master Quarto thanks to my online course: Productive R Workflow\nThis document aims at showcasing how a quarto document made with the lumo format looks like."
